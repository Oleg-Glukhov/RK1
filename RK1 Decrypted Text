IN ESSENCE, A COMPUTER IS A MACHINE DESIGNED TO PROCESS, STORE,
AND RETRIEVE DATA. DATA MAY BE NUMBERS IN A SPREADSHEET, CHARACTERS
OF TEXT IN A DOCUMENT, DOTS OF COLOR IN AN IMAGE, WAVEFORMS OF
SOUND, OR THE STATE OF SOME SYSTEM, SUCH AS AN AIR CONDITIONER OR A
CD PLAYER. ALL DATA IS STORED IN THE COMPUTER AS NUMBERS. IT’S EASY
TO FORGET THIS WHEN WE’RE DEEP IN C CODE, CONTEMPLATING COMPLEX
ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES. THE COMPUTER MANIPULATES THE DATA
BY PERFORMING OPERATIONS ON THE NUMBERS. DISPLAYING AN IMAGE ON A
SCREEN IS ACCOMPLISHED BY MOVING AN ARRAY OF NUMBERS TO THE VIDEO
MEMORY, EACH NUMBER REPRESENTING A PIXEL OF COLOR. TO PLAY AN MP3
AUDIO FILE, THE COMPUTER READS AN ARRAY OF NUMBERS FROM DISK AND
INTO MEMORY, MANIPULATES THOSE NUMBERS TO CONVERT THE COMPRESSED
AUDIO DATA INTO RAW AUDIO DATA, AND THEN OUTPUTS THE NEW SET OF
NUMBERS (THE RAW AUDIO DATA) TO THE AUDIO CHIP. EVERYTHING THAT A
COMPUTER DOES, FROM WEB BROWSING TO PRINTING, INVOLVES MOVING AND
PROCESSING NUMBERS. THE ELECTRONICS OF A COMPUTER IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO HOLD, MOVE, AND CHANGE NUMBERS. A COMPUTER
SYSTEM IS COMPOSED OF MANY PARTS, BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. AT
THE HEART OF THE COMPUTER IS THE PROCESSOR, THE HARDWARE THAT
EXECUTES THE COMPUTER PROGRAMS. THE COMPUTER ALSO HAS MEMORY, OFTEN
SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES IN ONE SYSTEM. THE MEMORY IS USED TO STORE
PROGRAMS WHILE THE PROCESSOR IS RUNNING THEM, AS WELL AS STORE THE
DATA THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE MANIPULATING. THE COMPUTER ALSO HAS
DEVICES FOR STORING DATA, OR EXCHANGING DATA WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
THESE MAY ALLOW THE INPUT OF TEXT VIA A KEYBOARD, THE DISPLAY OF
INFORMATION ON A SCREEN, OR THE MOVEMENT OF PROGRAMS AND DATA TO OR
FROM A DISK DRIVE.
